CartesianSandBox
================

A Cartesian Co-ordinate sandbox implemented in Java.

### Why am i coding this?  
One afternoon i wanted to draw two lines to see if they intersect. 
But i did not have access to pen and paper, not so suprisingly. And i was not 
able to find an application online that could let me to so. And so i decided to
code one up in Java as a desktop application, and with the possibility of
extending this as a web application.
